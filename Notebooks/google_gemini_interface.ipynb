    "Adjustable coilover suspension, high-performance tyres, and optimised quattro sport differential enhance the driving dynamics\n",
    "Only 660 units worldwide and heritage decals based on the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO guarantee exclusivity\n",
    "\n",
    "February 2024, Johannesburg – The new Audi RS 6 Avant GT is the pinnacle of the model series. This special edition is packed with exclusive details for both the exterior and the interior. An impressive pass-through roof edge spoiler, redefined diffuser, and 22-inch wheels in a distinctive design underscore its top position in the model series. The interior features bucket seats, a fresh colour combination, and individual numbering in the centre console. Lightweight adjustable coilover suspension unique to the RS 6 Avant GT and a reworked quattro sport differential on the rear axle sharpen the driving experience. The twin-turbocharged V8 engine delivers 463kW and 850Nm of torque from 2,300 to 4,500 rpm.\n",
    "The idea of the Audi RS 6 Avant GT goes back to the apprentice project RS 6 GTO concept from 2020. Twelve apprentices learning to work as bodywork and vehicle construction mechanics, automotive mechanics, automotive painters, and tooling mechanics worked on the project for six months with the support of Audi Design. They took most of their inspiration from the legendary Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO race car from 1989. The result shows the range of ways in which young talents can contribute to the company even during their apprenticeship.\n",
    "An unparalleled appearance\n",
    "The new Audi RS 6 Avant GT stands out from the RS 6 Avant performance (which will remain available) thanks to its even more impressive appearance based on the RS 6 GTO concept. The striking front end takes obvious inspiration from the RS 6 GTO concept. The Singleframe and the air intakes are finished entirely in high-gloss black, which makes the car appear even lower and wider. Vertical blades in the front apron, a new intake grille, and a powerful front splitter integrated into the bumper enhance the sharpened look.\n",
    "For the first time, Audi Sport GmbH is not only using a fully redesigned bonnet but is also manufacturing it from carbon fibre. The one-of-a-kind finish makes the redesigned bonnet’s carbon material a real eye-catcher, and it is impressively framed by the color of the body. Integrated air outlets behind the large 22-inch wheels reduce air pressure in the wheel arch and improve brake cooling. Like the hood, the fenders housing the large wheels are made entirely of carbon fiber for the first time – a highlight on the vehicle itself as well as for Audi production.\n",
    "The side profile is defined by inserts in the side skirts, exterior mirror covers in glossy carbon and the 22-inch wheels in the 6-spoke design made exclusively for the RS 6 Avant GT.\n",
    "At the rear, the special edition impresses with black “RS 6 GT” lettering, a tailgate specially adapted to the design with a visually lowered loading edge, a functional diffuser with a vertically centered reflector that makes the car appear even wider, and a distinctive double wing inspired by motorsport. The latter was taken almost 1:1 from the apprentices’ concept car. For the first time in the history of the RS 6 Avant, the roof rails have been removed for an even flatter, sportier silhouette.\n",
    "For the RS 6 Avant GT, customers have the option to choose exclusive decals in two colours. The first, in conjunction with an Arkona White finish, combines the traditional colors of Audi Sport: black, grey, and red. The model badges at the front and rear also come in these colours. If this color combination is chosen, the wheels in the distinctive design always come in high-gloss white. Alternatively, the decals in black and grey tones come with the exterior colour Nardo grey or Mythos black. To match, Audi Sport GmbH offers the high-sheen wheels in high-gloss black or matte black. The four rings in the Singleframe and the tailgate along with the model lettering are black as standard. The following finishes are available for the exterior: Arkona White, Nardo Gray, Chronos Gray Metallic, Madeira Brown Metallic, and Mythos Black Metallic.\n",
    "The RS 6 Avant GT rolls off the production line with the RS design package plus as standard. The black interior is enhanced by numerous accents in the exclusive colour combination of red and copper, for example the stitching on the steering wheel, the sides of the centre console, the centre armrest and door armrests and the floor mats with “RS 6 GT” lettering. The new RS bucket seats in a leather-Dinamica combination and the “RS 6 GT” lettering right below the headrests also feature this colour scheme. The honeycomb stitching in the centre of the seat shimmers in Express red, while that on the outer seam of the bucket seat is finished in copper.\n",
    "The armrests, the dashboard, the centre console including its sides, and the door waist rails are upholstered in Dinamica black microfibre, while the decorative inlays are covered in Dinamica deep black microfibre. The decorative inlays are also available in an open-pore carbon twill structure as an option. The seat belts catch the eye with their full crimson red colour. As a special highlight, the center console features the car’s serial number in the limited run of 660.\n",
    "Next-level performance\n",
    "The new RS 6 Avant GT has a power output of 463kW and a maximum torque figure of 850Nm. The spearhead of the series sprints from 0-100km/h in 3.3 seconds, accelerates to 200km/h from a standstill in just 11.5 seconds and the top speed is 305km/h. As standard, the RS 6 Avant GT features the RS ceramic brake system.\n",
    "The power of the 4.0 TFSI is applied to the permanent all-wheel drive quattro via the standard eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox with optimised shift times. Like the RS 6 Avant performance, the RS 6 Avant GT uses the latest version of the locking centre differential. Particularly light and compact, it distributes engine power to the front and rear axle at ratio of 40:60. If slippage occurs, more drive torque is automatically applied to the axle with better traction – up to 70 percent can flow to the front axle and up to 85 percent to the rear axle. The reworked centre differential improves driving dynamics, ensures noticeably more precise cornering, and makes for less understeer at the limit.\n",
    "To further distinguish this variant from other RS models, the quattro sport differential on the rear axle has been specially tuned. The new parameters focus on greater agility and rear bias in “dynamic” driving mode. Customers benefit from sporty, neutral, and precise handling. For the first time, and only for the RS 6 Avant GT, adjustable coilover suspension comes as standard. It lowers the ride height by 10mm compared to the RS 6 Avant and offers a perfect combination of dynamics and comfort. A higher spring rate, triple-adjustable dampers, and stiffer stabilisers (30 percent stiffer at the front and 80 percent at the rear) ensure less body roll, which once again increases the fun factor. The necessary tools and instructions for making individual adjustments are also on board. Customers can alternatively order the RS sport suspension plus with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC), or the RS adaptive air suspension.\n",
    "The new high-performance Continental “Sport Contact 7” 285/30 R22 tyres ensure the necessary grip for dynamic driving. The tyres offer consistently better roadholding under both dry and wet conditions and reduce understeer when cornering at speed, making for overall more precise handling across the entire speed range. Additionally, the braking distance is up to two metres shorter with the new tyres when braking from 100-0km/h.\n",
    "Manufacturing of the highest grade\n",
    "Unlike the regular RS 6 Avant performance, the GT is not entirely assembled on the production line in Neckarsulm. After the body construction works and painting shop, the 660 models goes to Böllinger Höfe, where the R8, e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT are built. Located near Audi’s production site in Neckarsulm, this highly flexible facility is unique within the Group and thus offers the best conditions for finishing the Audi RS 6 Avant GT there. Final assembly is carried out by seven experienced employees at three assembly stations set up especially for this exclusive special edition. Each individual vehicle spends a whole day there. All GT-specific features are fitted by hand. This includes the bonnet, the fenders, the rocker panels, the double wing, the front and rear aprons, and the adjustable coilover suspension.\n",
    "[Note to editors: Audi South Africa can confirm our market will receive one of these limited-edition RS 6 Avant GT units. It’s set to arrive locally in Q2 2024.]\n",
